# OpenAiCli

## Introduction

**OpenAiCli** is a command-line interface tool designed to communicate seamlessly with OpenAI's ChatGPT. With the recent modifications to [OpenAI's web UI](https://chat.openai.com), it's become imperative to devise a more direct method to access the ChatGPT API. This project aims to bridge that gap and possibly introduce additional features over time.

> If you're searching for something more intricate, consider exploring [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT). The inspiration for this tool was originally rooted in the Python code [found here](https://pastebin.com/kWZ5b2Sf), authored by an anonymous user.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- **OpenAI API Key**: You can obtain this from OpenAI's official website.

## Usage

Follow these steps for a smooth experience with OpenAiCli:

1. **Clone**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jareid/OpenAiCli.git
   ```

2. **IDE Setup**: Launch the project in your preferred Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans recommended).

3. **API Key Configuration**: Navigate to the `Main.java` file within the `src` directory and replace the placeholder `"API KEY HERE"` with your OpenAI API key.

4. **Build & Run**: Execute the `Main.java` file.

5. **Interact with ChatGPT**: The application will request input. Type in your message and hit Enter.

6. **Exit**: To terminate the application, input `"QUIT"`.

7. **History**: All conversation details will be preserved in `hist.txt` within the project's main directory.

8. **Save Python Code**: If you'd like to save the Python code generated by ChatGPT, exit the application by typing `"QUIT"`. This will be stored in a `last.py` file in the root directory.

### Command Line Options

The application supports the following command line arguments:
- `--cli` or `-c`: Operate in CLI mode (default).
- `--ui` or `-u`: Launch the JavaFX UI mode.
For instance:
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="--javafx"
```
Will launch the JavaFX UI mode.
