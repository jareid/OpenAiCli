# OpenAiCli

A command line tool to talk with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

This project has been created due to necessity, as of July 07 2023.
The web Ui for [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com) appears to have been dumbed down, whether that is due to server costs,
they are planning to create premium version now people are aware of how well it CAN behave or, other reasons
doesn't matter.
The API still functions well so this project is to circumvent that and add a few cool features as we go.

If you want something more complex, look at [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)

Original based on the python code by an unknown user here: https://pastebin.com/kWZ5b2Sf
